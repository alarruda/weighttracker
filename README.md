Weight Tracker README.md
Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The goal of the application was to be a well-rounded weight tracking application. The user should be able to log, review a history, modify previous entries, and set a weight goal. Upon reaching the weight goal, the app will notify the user via SMS.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
During development, I tried to develop with the customer in mind. Having a lot of experience with apps, I tried to focus on the human computer interaction to make a logical flow of screens, layouts, and themes.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
My approach was focusing on the user experience. I think in the future I will try to have a more code-focused approach to ensure functionality. I found that the good idea fairy would strike and distract me from the core feature functionality.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I tested with the emulator as a user would use the app. I definitely could have created unit tests and implemented format constraints for passwords, usernames/emails.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
This whole experience was extremely rewarding. Though I didn't finish the application, I learned more than I could have imagined. This class was exellent and full of new challenges that were fun to overcome. Generally, learning the app development ecosystem was the biggest challenge, but understanding how everything worked in harmony to function as expected was tough.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I think my expertise lies in the layout and theme. Though there is certainly room for improvement, I found that the design was the most fun.
